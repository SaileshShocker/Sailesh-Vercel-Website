            üöÄ AI, Data Science & Analytics Professional
Hey there! üëã I'm a curious and driven AI, Data Science, and Analytics professional with over 2 years of experience transforming raw data into intelligent solutions that drive business growth.

I work across a wide range of technologies ‚Äî from üìä Data Analytics and ü§ñ Machine Learning to üí¨ Natural Language Processing (NLP), üìö Large Language Models (LLMs), üé® Generative AI, and üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision. I've built and deployed several detection models and love solving complex problems with AI.

I specialize in end-to-end development, from analyzing and cleaning data to deploying full-stack AI applications in the cloud.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies I Use:

üêç Python for ML, automation, and scripting

üíæ SQL & MongoDB for working with structured and unstructured data

‚òÅÔ∏è AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform for scalable AI solutions

üíª Flask & Streamlit for building interactive apps

üìä Power BI for business intelligence and data visualization

‚öôÔ∏è MS Power Automate for automating workflows

‚ú® I'm passionate about building smart, scalable systems and discovering innovative ways to unlock value from data and AI.

When I'm not coding or building, I'm usually sipping coffee ‚òï while diving into the latest in AI, NLP, and Generative AI.

Let's connect and build something amazing! üí°
